basic needs are exploited and sold. earth, wind, fire, water, the sun. if humans can touch it or can't touch it, they'll sell it. if they can think about it, they can sell it. consumers competing for resources. society is obsessed with 'data' and algorithms.

present the data and algorithms without hiding them or manipulating people with them, and we might be able to move towards clean energy almost entirely.
